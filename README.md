# Musical Harmony Analysis – README

This project performs MIR-based (Music Information Retrieval) analysis of audio tracks (MP3, M4A/ALAC, FLAC, WAV…) without relying on any machine‑learning datasets or Spotify Premium.  
Focused on DJ‑relevant signal features: rhythmic density, percussive character, tonal center, spectral balance, and transient sharpness.
Capability to load playlists in csv format (prepared for those generated by Engine DJ)

## 🎯 **Two Analysis Workflows**

### **1. Folder-Based Analysis** (`analyse_music.py`)
- Scans `music/` folder recursively
- Analyzes all audio files found
- Output: `analysis.csv`

### **2. Playlist-Based Analysis** (`analyse_from_playlist.py`)
- **Interactive CSV selection** from available playlist exports
- **Track range selection** (e.g., tracks 11-20)
- Uses file paths from playlist CSV (no `music/` folder needed)
- Preserves playlist metadata: `#`, `Title`, `Artist`, `Album`
- Output: `analysis_[playlist]_tracks_[start]-[end].csv`
- **Ideal for analyzing DJ sets in playlist order**

## 📊 **Visualization Tools**

### **`plot_analysis.py`**
- Visualizes `analysis.csv` (folder-based analysis)
- Multi-panel bar charts for all MIR features

### **`plot_from_playlist.py`**
- **Interactive visualization** for playlist-based analysis (build for Engine DJ CSV exports)
- **Sorted by playlist order** (track #)
- **Category headers**: Energy Profile, Rhythmic Intensity, Spectral Balance
- **Key display**: Color-coded by mode (🟢 Major / 🔴 Minor)
- **Single-row layout** with track labels shown once
- Output: `[input_filename]_plot.png`

## 🎵 **Analyzed Audio Parameters (Explained Technically)**

Below are all low‑complexity, fully deterministic DSP metrics extracted from audio in this project.  
Each metric is based on established MIR methods (Essentia, Librosa) and corresponds to DJ‑relevant perceptual qualities.

---

## **1. Key (Tónina) & Mode (Major/Minor)**  
**Method:** Essentia `KeyExtractor`  
- Detects global tonal center (e.g., F#, D, A♭).  
- Major/minor classification.  
- `key_strength` indicates model confidence.

**Usage for DJs:** harmonic mixing, Camelot mapping, color-coded grouping.

---

## **2. BPM (Tempo)**  
**Method:** Essentia `RhythmExtractor2013`  
- Robust beat detection using multi-feature estimation.  
- `bpm_confidence` for reliability.

**Usage:** verifying tempo, detecting problematic files (rips, edits).

**Note:** BPM is computed but **not displayed in playlist visualizations** since DJs typically adjust tempo manually (not informative for mix planning).

---

## **3. RMS Energy**  
**What it represents:** raw physical energy of the waveform.

**Why it matters:** correlates with perceived punch, but does not equal loudness.  
Useful as a neutral, gain‑independent baseline.

**Visualization:**
- **RMS Energy** (`rms_mean`) – average energy level
- High → hi nrg songs (Anna and Kittin - Forever Ravers)
- Low → generally lo enrgy, but also 90s dance (Westbam - Beatbox Rocker) 

- **Energy Variation** (`rms_std`) – dynamic range / energy fluctuation

Parameters:
- `rms_mean`  
- `rms_std`

---

## **4. Percussive Ratio (HPSS)**  
**Method:** Harmonic–Percussive Source Separation  
Measures how much of the signal consists of *transients / drum hits* vs *pads / harmonic content*. Distinguishes percussion-driven vs pad-driven tracks.


- High → techno, electro, but also drum-only tracks (Peace Orchestra - Shining)  
- Low → deep house, ambient, groove‑light tracks (Miss Kittin - Cosmid Address)


**Visualization:** Displayed under **"Energy Profile"** category alongside RMS Energy.

Parameter:
- `percussive_ratio`

---

## **5. Onset Rate (Rhythmic Density)**  
**Meaning:** counts how many transient events per second occur. High also in music composed of square signals.

This reliably captures:
- **1/8 hats** (high onset density → energetic feel), e.g. Charlotte de Witte - Power of Thought  
- **1/4 hats** (lower density → drop in groove), e.g. Soul clap - Wicked (gentler sound)

**indicator of groove intensity** – directly corresponds to perceived rhythmic activity.

**Visualization:** Displayed under **"Rhythmic Intensity"** category alongside Attack Sharpness.

Parameter:
- `onset_rate` (events per second)

---

## **6. Spectral Centroid (Brightness)**  
**Meaning:** where the "center of mass" of spectral energy lies.  
- High values → crisp, hi-hat heavy, sizzle
- Low values → warm, dark, deep

**Visualization:**
- **Brightness** (`centroid_mean`) – average timbral brightness. "Clarity"

- High: more clear sound - Miss Kittin - 1993 EACID 
- Low: deeper darker tracks -  Miss Kittin - Cosmic adress

- Not displayed: `centroid_std` (timbral variation over time)

Parameters:
- `centroid_mean` (Hz)  
- `centroid_std` (Hz)

---

## **7. Spectral Flux (Spectral Dynamics)**  
**Meaning:** how much the spectrum changes frame‑to‑frame.  
Tracks with strong percussion and rhythmic movement have high flux. Hard to hear for me.  

**Correlates with:** rhythmic heartbeat, spectral activity, dynamic changes

**Visualization:** Displayed as **"Spectral Flux"**

Parameters:
- `flux_mean`
- `flux_std`

---

## **8. High-Frequency Ratio (≥ 6 kHz)**  
A proxy for the **hi-hat / shimmer layer**. How much heighs. subjecitvelly similar to brighntess.

- High → crisp top end, energetic hats, eg Miss Kittin 1993 EACID.   
- Low → muffled, soft, pad‑driven, eg Miss Kittin Cosmic Address

**Visualization:** Displayed under **"Spectral Balance"** category as **"HF Ratio (≥6kHz)"**

Parameter:
- `hf_ratio`

---

## **9. Bass Ratio (< 200 Hz)**  
Measures low‑end dominance.

- High → sub-heavy, bass-driven tracks. e.g. Miss Kittin - Cosmic adress
- Low → mid/high-focused, lighter bass presence. e.g. Storm - Time to Burn (and many older pre-loudness war electornic dance tracks) 
- Useful to identify tracks with strong sub/bass  
- Helps characterize balance (sub‑heavy vs mid‑heavy tracks)
- when mid-heavy track follow a sub-heavy one, energy breaks on a dancefloor.

**Visualization:** Displayed under **"Spectral Balance"** category as **"Bass Ratio (<200Hz)"**

Parameter:
- `bass_ratio`

---

## **10. Attack Sharpness**  
Derived from the slope of the onset envelope.  
Captures how "hard" the transient attacks are. 

- High → electro/techno punchy kicks, sharp transients, "ždímačka", ek Felix Cartal Stranger Things remix
- Low → deep house smooth edges, soft, mellow attacks, e.g. Westbam - Oldschool baby

**One of the best indicators of track character** – distinguishes aggressive vs smooth production styles.

**Visualization:** Displayed under **"Rhythmic Intensity"** category alongside Onset Rate.

Parameter:
- `attack_sharpness`

---

- Clustering analysis based on audio features
- Heatmaps showing feature correlations

### **5. Spotify Audio Feature Fallback**  
If a track exists on Spotify:
- fetch ML‑derived features (danceability, valence…)  
- merge with local DSP metrics  
(No Spotify Premium required for these endpoints.)

# 🧪 Notes on Audio Processing

- All audio is decoded on-the-fly (MP3, M4A/ALAC, FLAC, WAV, AAC).  
- Sampling rate is automatically resampled to 44.1 kHz.  
- Bit depth does not matter (16/24/32 float → normalized internally).  
- Stereo mix → mono for stable analysis.
