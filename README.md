Analysis of key of my played tracks

## Analysis of Spotify playlists

First CSVs with musical key needed to be created. This was done using https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-sorter/. This creates CSVs with all song-related metadata (also Energy etc), but, mostly, with Key. The key comes both in musical notation and in a column Camelot also in machine-readable format 1A, 1B, etc.
